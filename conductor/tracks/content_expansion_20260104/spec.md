## Specification

This track focuses on enriching the existing content of the Responsible AI presentation tool. The primary goal is to expand the current set of tiles with new cases, examples, and detailed explanations related to responsible AI. This will involve:

1.  **Adding New Tile Data:** Introduce new `TileData` entries into `src/constants.ts` or a similar configuration.
2.  **Developing New Content:** Create compelling and informative text, images, or other media for these new tiles.
3.  **Integrating New Tiles into the Grid:** Ensure the new tiles are properly displayed within the application's grid layout.
4.  **Ensuring Responsiveness and Accessibility:** Verify that all new content and tiles adhere to the established visual identity, tone of voice, and accessibility guidelines.
5.  **Reviewing and Refining Existing Content (Optional):** As part of the expansion, opportunities to improve existing content for clarity, engagement, and accuracy should be considered.
